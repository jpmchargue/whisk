#Whisk 
Whisk is an automatic, lightweight sentence mixer built on Gentle and Pydub, written primarily in Python.
It can be used both as an application and a library (via whisk.py).

##Quick Setup
*I haven't been able to thoroughly test the setup process yet, so this process may not work universally!*
1. Save the Whisk repository to your device using *git clone*.
	* If you don't know how that works, there are dozens of tutorials on it online.
1. Open the root directory of the repository (whisk) in a terminal.
1. Run *sudo ./setup.sh*. This will install Gentle and its dependencies.
1. Once that completes, run *python3 launch.py* to launch Whisk.
